# Arbitrary-Storage-Protocol-ASP-v1
The protocol supports the storage and retrieval of arbitrary data for the duration of a network session.  Information exchange between the client and server are handled in a one-to-one fashion, i.e. each request by the client is met with a response from the server.  These requests are handled by presenting access methods to the server.  The server will respond with a response code which indicates that the client should proceed, the method was a success, or an error occurred.
